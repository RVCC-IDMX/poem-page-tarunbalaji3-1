        <h1>Full of Life, Now</h1>
        <h2>by Walt Whitman (1819â€“1892)</h2>
        <p>
          FULL of life, now, compact, visible,<br />
          I, forty years old the Eighty-third Year of The States,<br />
          To one a century hence, or any number of centuries hence,<br />
          To you, yet unborn, these, seeking you.<br /><br />
          When you read these, I, that was visible, am become invisible;<br />
          Now it is you, compact, visible, realizing my poems, seeking me;<br />
          Fancying how happy you were, if I could be with you, and become your
          comrade;<br />
          Be it as if I were with you. (Be not too certain but I am now with
          you.)
